Q10. Suppose there are two singly linked lists both of which intersect at some point and 
become a singly list. The head or starting pointers for the both lists are known, but the 
intersecting node is not known. Also the number of nodes in each of the lists before 
they intersect is unknown and may be different in each list. List1 may have n nodes 
before it reaches the intersection point, and list2 might have m nodes before it reaches 
the intersection point where m and n may be m=n, m<n or m>n. write a program for 
find a merging node.
